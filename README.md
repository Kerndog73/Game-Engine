# Game-Engine
This is a simple game engine written in C++ which currently doesn't have a name because I'm not all that creative. Does anyone have any ideas?

Its less of a game engine, more of a few utilities that someone making a game might need. It it had a UI system but I didn't like the design so I made another one and it was pretty good and supported pretty animations but I didn't like it's design either so now I'm thinking of a better design but while I do that I'm working on the resource cache.

I'm still yet to design mesh format thats why the 3D folder is pretty much empty. I built a very simple wireframe software renderer but then I found OpenGL so I abandoned that.

The design is lossly based on the one described in Game Coding Complete (4th edition) by Mike McShaffry and David "Rez" Graham but not so similar as I copy directly from the book.
