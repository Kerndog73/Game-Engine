This **was** a simple game engine written in C++...

The above screenshot is about as far as I got but then I stumbled apon some useful advice. [Write games, not engines](https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/) I was destined to fail. When I thought I could make a game, I tried and failed. What I really should be doing is making games. 

I'm not ready to make an engine from scratch. The most complicated game I made before beginning the engine was Mario (preloaded with world 1-1) in JavaScript. I was trying to make a game engine that could handle something like Counter Strike - Global Offensive.

So please, don't try to write a game engine from scratch. You'll just end up learning the lesson I did.

I'm still going to leave this repo here because there might be a few things in older versions that might be useful. (Like a resource manager)
