//this resource cache is proving to be rather inflexable

//it can't handle custom allocation. it allocates the memory and hands it to
//the loader. Storing an XML document in one contigous block of memory
//would require a custom memory manager. tinyxml2 has its own memory manager
//but doesn't allow the use of a custom memory manager.
//i dont want to edit the library

//another thing missing from tinyxml2 is a function to traverse the document
//and count the number of bytes in use. That way i could at least limit
//the size of the cache

//i could have a guess and say the allocation size is a bit bigger than the file
//because an xml document is mostly text so all that text from the file will
//be in the DOM. but if getSize returned a number greater than zero the cache
//would allocation that amount
